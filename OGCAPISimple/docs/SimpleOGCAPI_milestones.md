## DB Connection (--> 20.01.2020)
The DB connection to the SQLite DB and to the PostreSQL DB are working. A solution for the PostGis extension has been found. A suitable library for the GEOJSon part is working. 

## Basic structure (--> 02.03.2020)
The basic paths are already working. The Login (including the User-Config file and the frontend part) is implemented. The file structure for the table and column names (to rename them) was thought up and is already implemented as well as the possibility to save the generated sql.

## Frontend + Filters (--> 15.04.2020)
The oppertunity to change the names of the tables and the columns is implemented. The SQL Query (which is saved in the config file) can be executed as well as edited. All error messages can be displayed in a special "box". The different filters to generate the sql query will be working.

## Testing + Bug fixes (--> 01.05.2020)
The test cases will be implemented and id they won't succeed, we have to fix the problem.
