# The OGC SensorThings API

To quote the standard itself:

> The OGC SensorThings API is an OGC standard specification for providing an open and unified way to interconnect IoT devices, data, and applications over the Web.
> The SensorThings API is an open standard, builds on Web protocols and the OGC Sensor Web Enablement standards, and applies an easy-to-use REST-like style.

SensorThings API provides access to up-to-date measurement information that is:

* RESTful
* (Geo)JSON encoded
* Available via OASIS Odata URL patterns and query options
* Capable of directly including sensor data via the ISO MQTT protocol

This means that data from the API can be easily viewed using a normal Web Browser. One can simply navigate from one object to the next by clicking the URLs provided within the data.

For more information, please see the following sections:
* [Deployment](2_Deploy.html)
* [Requesting Data](3_GettingData.html)
* [Creating Maps](4_Mapping.html)
