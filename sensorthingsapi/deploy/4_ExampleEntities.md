# Example Entities

Here are example entities, with their required fields:


## Datastream

```javascript
{
  "name" : "Temperature in the Kitchen",
  "description" : "The temperature in the kitchen, measured by the sensor next to the window",
  "observationType": "http://www.opengis.net/def/observationType/OGC-OM/2.0/OM_Measurement",
  "unitOfMeasurement": {
    "name": "Degree Celsius",
    "symbol": "°C",
    "definition": "ucum:Cel"
  },
  "Thing": {"@iot.id": 999},
  "Sensor": {"@iot.id": 999},
  "ObservedProperty": {"@iot.id": 999}
}
```


## FeatureOfInterest

The FeatureOfInterest is often autogenerated from the Location of the Thing.
```javascript
{
  "name": "0113330020070312",
  "description": "Water Sample from L'HALLUE À DAOURS (80) taken on 2007-03-12 at 00:00:00",
  "properties": {},
  "encodingType": "application/geo+json",
  "feature": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
        8.10,
        50.00
    ]
  }
}
```


## Location

```javascript
{
  "name": "Location of the kitchen",
  "description": "This is where the kitchen is",
  "properties": {},
  "encodingType": "application/geo+json",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [8.10, 50.00]
  }
}
```


## Observation

When creating Observations there are some additional rules:
- If the phenomenonTime is not given, the server will use the current time as phenomenonTime.
- If the featureOfInterest is not given, the server will use a FeatureOfInterest generated from the Location of the Thing of the Datasteam.
- If the resultTime is not given, the value `null` is used.

This version of Observation can be used to POST to `v1.1/Datastreams(...)/Observations`
```javascript
{
  "result": 49,
  "phenomenonTime": "2020-10-11T12:13:14+02:00"
}
```

This version of Observation can be used to POST to `v1.1/Observations`
```javascript
{
  "result": 49,
  "phenomenonTime": "2020-10-11T12:13:14+02:00",
  "Datastream": {"@iot.id": 999}
}
```


## ObservedProperty

```javascript
{
  "name": "Temperature",
  "description": "Temperature",
  "properties": {},
  "definition": "http://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabularyconcept/aq/meteoparameter/54"
}
```


## Sensor

```javascript
{
  "name": "HDT22",
  "description": "A cheap sensor that measures Temperature and Humidity",
  "properties": {},
  "encodingType": "application/pdf",
  "metadata": "https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf"
}
```


## Thing

```javascript
{
  "name" : "Kitchen",
  "description" : "The Kitchen in my house",
  "properties" : {
    "oven" : true,
    "heatingPlates" : 4
  }
}
```
