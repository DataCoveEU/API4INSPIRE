# SensorThings API Viewer

While APIs are cool, and provide access to a wealth of data, a picture is still worth more than 1000 words. 
Thus, while having access to a SensorThings API endpoint is cool, being able to visualize it is even cooler!

Here you find a very primitive but effective SensorThings API Viewer, courtesy of Tomas Kliment at Klimeto as well as the DanubeHack.

Basic viewer specification was as follows (Keep in mind, this was a last minute save at a hackathon! 4 hours til the end, and nothing to show):
* Dots on Map
* Klick Dots
* Get Numbers & Graphs 
* GO!!!

In the 4 hours required to put some meteorological data online, Tomas did the viewer (it's been polished a bit since, but not much), not bad for a Sunday morning:
